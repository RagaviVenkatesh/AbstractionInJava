# Netflix-Style Java Abstraction 🧑‍💻🍿

This project demonstrates **Abstraction in Java** using a Netflix analogy.  
Abstract classes define a blueprint, and concrete classes (like Mobile and Smart TV players) implement that blueprint.

## 💡 Concept

- `NetflixPlayer` is an abstract class with a method `play()` and a concrete method `pause()`.
- `MobileNetflixPlayer` and `SmartTVNetflixPlayer` implement the abstract method in their own way.
- Demonstrates abstraction + upcasting in Java.

## 🏃‍♂️ Run the Code

1. Clone the repo  
2. Compile with:  
   `javac *.java`  
3. Run with:  
   `java AbstractionDemo`


Happy streaming (your code)! 🎬
